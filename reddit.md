Title: I made a real-time discussion board for everything via fully anonymous.
Content:This app alike snapchat for ideas. You can chat others with same trend topic, snap ideas, even ask a question to the whole country! I'm trying to done this app.

# Why I did?

I imagine a social platform for discussions but without harassment. Anonimity can work this situation. Then I made quick POC (Proof of Concept).

# Which tech stack I used?

Tick.chat's tech stack is extremely lightweight. Everyone can read & understand backend code. Backend is written in Node.js via socket.io for "real-time" think. Frontend is written in Vue.js. I choosed Vue.js for state management and component based structure. I'm not a expert at software developing/engineering. That's the reason Tick may have tons of bugs. If any bug or proposal please open issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/cagataycali/tick.chat), PR's are welcome.
